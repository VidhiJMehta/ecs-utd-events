## Front-End

Directions on running Front-End in dev environment can be found inside `front-end` folder README

**NOTE:** Make sure to use git from external repo (i.e. `ecs-utd-events`) not from inside of `front-end` folder
It will be helpful also in VSCode if you open the entire `ecs-utd-events` folder and then just focus on `front-end` since the external Git history will show up instead of the internal one generated in `front-end`
