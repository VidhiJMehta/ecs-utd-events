Please add [FE]/[BE]/[ALL] tags to Git Commits to specify if they affect Front-End/Back-End/ALL :)

## Front-End

Directions on running Front-End in dev environment can be found inside '''front-end''' folder README

**NOTE:** Make sure to use git from external repo (i.e. '''utd-ecs-events''') not from inside of '''front-end''' folder
It will be helpful also in VSCode if you open the entire utd-ecs-events folder and then just focus on '''front-end''' since the external Git history will show up instead of the internal one generated in '''front-end'''
